Key Features Implemented
Multi-Agent Routing: The system correctly identifies intent ("book", "style") and switches agents.
Tool Use: The 
BookingAgent
 successfully queried and updated the 
MockCalendarTool
.
Context Retention: The system maintained state across turns (though simple for this demo).
Next Steps for Production
Replace 
MockCalendarTool
 with real Google Calendar API.
Integrate real Gemini 1.5 Pro API for the 
ConsultationAgent
.
Deploy to a cloud runtime (e.g., Cloud Run) as an API.
